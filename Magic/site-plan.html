    <p>
      People at some point want to get out of their stress and to be able to marvel at amazing things, in this world of
      change we often do not perceive the beauty of nature or the subtlety of things; our eyes are closed and we do not
      reach the progress and inspiration in our minds.
      <br>
      <br>
      Our page is made precisely for that, to show everyone what every child knows and that the adult forgets that life
      is full of dreams and that every great idea begins as a dream, from Da Vinci to Copernicus each and every one of
      them not only spoke or wrote, but felt their knowledge in paintings, books, sculptures etc..
      <br>
      <br>
      Because paintings are not only images but inspiration and at the time a reality, they show us our desires and our
      fears, our happiness and sadness, abundance and poverty.
      <br>
      <br>
      Sculptures are not just rocks, but show us the fine skill and patience of mankind.
      <br>
      <br>
      Books not only paper, but the abundance of the world and the treasure of the earth, our legacy, our inheritance.

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
